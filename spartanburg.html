<h1>Spartanburg</h1>
<h3><i>“Service is our business”</i></h3>
<p>Spartanburg, SC is the 13th most populous city in the state of South Carolina. It was incorporated in 1831, but its history extends back to 1753 when a treaty with the Cherokee Indian Nation opened up the area for settlers. Spartanburg County was formed in 1785. Its name stems from the <a href="https://www.carolana.com/SC/Revolution/patriot_militia_sc_spartan_regiment.html">Spartan Regiment</a>, a militia unit which participated in the Revolutionary War.&nbsp;</p>
